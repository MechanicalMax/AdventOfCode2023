## Reflection
Great puzzles in the beginning. I was able to solve a lot of them in the first two weeks, but towards the end things became much more complex. Thankfully, the hyper-neutrino videos were a huge help. I referenced my sources when I directly used outside code or algorithms. Happy to solve these again this year! These puzzles were a nice distraction from finals week
